##Selector identification

Identify the selectors in each style and what HTML element(s) they target.
Also, which of these examples have errors? What are they?

###1
```
p {
  color: white;
}
```

###2
```
span {
  padding: 15px;
}
```

###3
```
table td {
  background-color: #222222;
}
```

###4
```
.lede-section left-side {
  position: absolute;
}
```

###5
```
section-9 {
  display: block;
  text-decoration: underline;
  ;
}
```

##What's different about the following three selectors?

###6
```
.fewd25-page-section .another-class {there is a space
  text-align: center;
}
```


###7
```
.fewd25-page-section, .another-class { there is a ((,))
