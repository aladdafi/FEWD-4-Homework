##Selector identification

Identify the selectors in each style and what HTML element(s) they target. Also, which of these examples have errors? What are they?

###1

p { color: white; }

Selector = p 
Property = color
Value  = white

###2

span { padding: 15px; }


Selector = span
Property = padding
Value  = 15px

###3 here error

table td { color: #222; }

Selector = td & table
Property = color
Value  = #222

// error is the two Selector do not have any commas
the correct =  table , td { color: #222; }
 

###4  here error 

.lede-section #left-side { position: absolute;}

Selector = .lede-section  &   #left-side
Property = position
Value  = absolute

 // error is the two Selector do not have any commas

the correct =  .lede-section , #left-side { position: absolute; }

###5

#section-9 {
  display: block
  text-decoration: underline;
  font-weight: bold;
}

Selector = #section-9
Property = display & text-decoration & font-weight 
Value  = block & underline & bold

##What's different about the following three selectors?

###6

.fewd25-page-section .another-class {
  text-align: center;
}
###7

.fewd25-page-section, .another-class {
  text-align: center;
}
###8

.fewd25-page-section.another-class {
  text-align: center;
}

The difference is: 
number ###6 There is a space between the selector but no comma and it's error.
number ###7 There is no space between the selector and there is a comma which is true .
number ###8 There is a no space between the selector but no comma and it's error.
