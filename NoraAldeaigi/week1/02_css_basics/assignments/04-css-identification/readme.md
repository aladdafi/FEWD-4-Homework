##Selector identification

Identify the selectors in each style and what HTML element(s) they target.
Also, which of these examples have errors? What are they?

###1
```
p {
  color: white;
}
paragraph 
```

###2
```
span {
  padding: 15px;
}
The <span> tag is used to group inline-elements in a document.

The <span> tag provides no visual change by itself.

The <span> tag provides a way to add a hook to a part of a text or a part of a document.
```

###3
```
table td {
  color: #222;
}
td propriety and value  
```

###4
```
.lede-section #left-side {
  position: absolute;
}
id and class
spareate by ,

```

###5
```
#section-9 {
  display: block
  text-decoration: underline;
  font-weight: bold;
}
id section-9
```

##What's different about the following three selectors?

###6
```
.fewd25-page-section .another-class {
  text-align: center;
}
```


###7
```
.fewd25-page-section, .another-class {
  text-align: center;
}
apply the propriety value in to  2 classes 
```


###8
```
.fewd25-page-section.another-class {
  text-align: center;
}
apply on subclass (another-class)
```
